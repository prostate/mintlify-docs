By default, your `config.toml` file will look like this:

```toml config.toml
[core]
license_key  = "ROO-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX" # Roobot License Key
private_key = "privatekey" # Private key of your wallet
rpc_url = "http://example.com" # HTTP RPC URL
send_tx_rpc_urls = ["http://example.com"] # RPC URLs to send txs to
wss_url = "ws://example.com" # Websocket URL

[inputs]
input_token = "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112" # The token you want to spend ( wSOL address )
output_token = "EKpQGSJtjMFqKZ9KQanSqYXRcF8fBopzLHYxdM65zcjm" # The token you want to buy ( WIF address )
input_amount = 0.0001 # The amount of input_token you want to spend
priority_fee_sol = 0.001 # Amount of extra SOL to pay in fees
txs_to_send = 625 # Amount of transactions to send
resend_interval_ms = 100 # How often to resend already generated txs
send_delay_ms = 2 # Delay between each transaction sent transactions
pre_create_token_account = true # Disables creating output token account in the setup when false

# Raydium specific configuration
[raydium]
abort_on_open_time = false # Set this to true if you want not to proceed if there is a pool open time in the future
send_before_open_time_ms = 1250 # How many milliseconds before open time to start sending transactions
amm_id = "w4Wc7nmjoXXX8DACreStkmK6trqjFo2NkkS4hgBf2nZ" # Pool ID

# Selling configuration
[sell]
priority_fee_sol = 0.001 # Priority fee
refresh_pnl_delay_ms = 30 # How many seconds to wait between PnL refreshes
wait_for_sell_confirmation = true # If true, It will await to confirm the sell transactions

# Jito usage is optional, learn about jito https://jito-labs.gitbook.io/mev/searcher-resources
[jito]
auth_keypair = "private-key-here" # jito auth keypair, for the wallet whitelisted by Jito. base58 or array
block_engine_url = "https://ny.mainnet.block-engine.jito.wtf" # Prefer a location close to your bot frankfurt, ny, amsterdam, tokyo
buy_tip_sol = 0.1
sell_tip_sol = 0.1

  IF YOU ARE NOT USING A FIELD, E.G `amm_id` - YOU NEED TO REMOVE THE ENTIRE LINE / COMMENT IT OUT USING A #. SAME FOR JITO SECTION

>
> *wSOL: `So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112`* \
> *USDC: `EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v`*
