<Note>
  Windows users MUST pre-install [vc_redist.x64.exe](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
</Note>

## Download the latest build from discord.
1. Once you have purchased a subscription, You will be able to access the `updates` channel.
2. Here you can find new versions of Roobot.
3. Choose your operating system, Either Windows or Linux. We currently do not support Mac.
4. Download the Binary, If you are on Windows you may have to disable `Real Time Protection`. If you are on linux, You can easily download by using `wget`

## Inital Setup

- Run the binary, If you do not already have a config file, It will create one.
- Configure the `config.toml`, Refer to [Configuration](https://docs.roobot.lol/basics/configuration)

## Usage

Linux Video Guide: [Setup Roobot on Ubuntu](https://youtu.be/lp5dJFBY0ng)

1. Roobot will instantly attempt to start when ran, According to your config.
2. Make sure you are properly configuring your config for the best results:

- if it’s an **opentime** pool: **you need ammid**
- if it’s a **stealth** drop, you **don’t need ammid**
- if it’s an existing pool ( bonk for example ) you don’t need ammid

<Note>
Roobot will always look for liquidity injection tx, or go based off opentime timer.
</Note>

Roobot & wSOL
- Roobot will always attempt to prewrap your `SOL > wSOL` before starting tasks.
- If you already have enough `wSOL` it will **not** attempt to wrap
- Your uPNL inside the sell module will be inaccurate if you have more wSOL than needed

**Best practice is to not prewrap your SOL manually, Let Roobot do all the work.**

Here is an example `config.toml` that has given me the best results for opentime:

```toml config.toml

license_key  = "ROO-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX"
